GLPhysSim MATTR File Specification v0.0

Attributes will be layed out as such:

[Attribute Name]:[value or expression]

Attributes may be functions of other attributes. The other attributes must be refernced by a "$" charchter. E.G.:

Density:($Temperature*$Pressure)0.637

You can also read in attributes from a data file, and the attribute's value will be found on a line between the nearest
greater X data point and nearest lesser X data point:

Density:@read(density_measurments.glpsdat)
