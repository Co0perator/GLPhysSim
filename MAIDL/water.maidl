material water: ;defining the material name

anno: ;annotation

	pref_shape: sphere ;sphere is the preferred rigid-body shape

	color: v3() ;the rendering color of this material

	mat_type: rigid ;Currently MAIDL(v0.0) only supports rigid-body interactions, but later versions may support other types of materials

	;^^^^ These are just example annotations

attrib:		;attributes
	f temp	;f is the floating point type. other types are i (integer), u (unsigned integer), l (long integer), o (object), b(boolean), and v2/v3/v4 (vector2/3/4)
	o neighbors[]	;this is an array of objects from the simulation (specifically the water particles within 0.1mm of it). Objects are referenced from an array stored by them sim. They are a rigid body.
	f pressure = 1	;you can give changeable default values
	f density
	b freezing
	b boiling
